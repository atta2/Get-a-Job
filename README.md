## Overview

_Get a Job!_ is an office battle simulator. Two players face off in a territory war style battle with office supplies as their weapons. The objective is to destroy the opponent’s base and kill the opponent, winning the match: both must be done to win. Your base acts as a respawn point and resource collector. With the gathered resources, you can )create stronger weapons to help defeat your opponent.

## Gameplay

The gameplay is very reminiscent of Brutal Legend, where the player commands a battalion while still taking charge and fighting enemies as well. The player would click or press to switch views between territory mode and destroying mode. Territory mode is where the player builds different buildings to gather resources as well as seeing the entire map. Destroying mode is where the player will fight with the opponent and map in first person; collecting upgrades, gathering building material etc. The primary modes of input would be keyboard and mouse or controller.

While in Destroying mode the player clicks the left mouse button (or controller button)  to fire their primary weapon and the right mouse button (other controller button)  to collect materials, the player can also press a key or button to switch to territory mode, to avoid accidental camera switching. While in territory mode the player clicks on designated areas to build their office building. That building will then auto generate a certain resource over time. While in territory mode the player Avatar will still be vulnerable to attack.

## Weapons and Building

Weapons come in three categories: melee, ranged, and explosive. Each category had multiple tiers, with better stats as the tier increase.
The map consists of two opposing buildings:  each has a parking lot in which the players create other buildings around. These other buildings can create enemies, collect resources, and design upgrades.  Each building has a specific size, and your parking lot/campus is only so big. Choose your placement wisely!

In addition to weapons and buildings, there are also power ups that spawn randomly around the map. Use these power ups, such as super health or max speed, to decimate your enemy.Back
